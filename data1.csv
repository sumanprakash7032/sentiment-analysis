"OPPO A5 2020 (Dazzling White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","
  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...,Pros.,1) good features considering cost 6800.,2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt,3) Speakers are good Dolby,4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...,5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...,6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800,7) 5000mAh battery,8) can be use as power bank for other phones,Cons:,1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...,2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...,This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...
,
  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,,Review score (out of 5),Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...,Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor),Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.,Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.,Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours),Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available,Pros : apart from above mentioned points :,1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung),2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.,3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly,4)face detection is fast,5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming,6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses,Cons:,1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high,2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option,3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro,4) no fast charger with pack

  Good Phone With Exchange
,
  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...,But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...,Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..,Thanks Oppo
,
  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge
,
  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?
,
  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device
,
  Pros- Phone looks actually good,  Good battery life,Cons- phone is too heavy,  Camera performance not upto the,  mark.,Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.
,
  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.
,
  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.,  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.,1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.,2. Smooth touch sensitivity,3. Ringtones are much louder.,4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.,5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.,6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.,7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.,8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.,8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.,  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.,By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.,We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".,Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.,  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.,-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.,What else needed in a phone.

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  good batter backup,good camera,good mob design,no any issue

  Nice product in this price... Good quality and look is aswm... Punch hole Camera and display is very attracting. Camera is also perfect and battery capacity is very high. This phone is no doubt very much good.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

  Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor.

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.
,
  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.,But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.,Not recommended.,Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  8000 rs for this mobile... It hurts,I thought it will be good but after looking the camera quality I started crying..,Redmi 8 is better than this coolpad 5.., it doesn't deserve 8000 rs..,Not good camera(blurry),Screen it not hd,Charger is looking like cheap..
,
  The hardware of the phone lives up to its specifications until now. 4GB RAM makes it snappy, 64GB internal storage gives you over 50GB unused space to start with, battery good for 1.5 days of basic use, gaming surprisingly is decent in medium settings, and camera okay-ish. The downside is the UI, not intuitive and looks a little old. Can be fixed if you change the ROM, but that will take time.

  I want to buy low priced featured smartphone and found this and I didn't regret my purchase.,It has great features at given price (5150 RS) in fact best phone to offer such features at price in current time.,Screen: not best if you use Samsung amoled display or premium brand products but definitely its great at price. Touch, screen quality is good and won't regret.,Performance: It's do job fantastic if you use for basic phone features, surfing and multiple tab is also good. I didn't feel any lagging. Performance is as good as xiaomi likes products.,Battery : battery is just okay doesn't have much to offer. Battery life is not so great and hardly last for day If 4g data and location is on as it has only 2400 mAH capacity. Best part is its removable battery so could be easy to change in future if required.,Charging is liitle slow and take much time to charge - no fast charging. It has micro USB ports.,Fingerprint is very good responsive and face unlock works great. Face unlock capabilities is appreciable.,Box includes phone, removable battery, charger, already applied Screen cover and TPU back cover with warranty card.,If you OK with battery and have budget friendly smartphone then suggest this is best phone to choose.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.,Good:,- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!,- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.,- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.,- 6000 Mah battery is BIG,- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.,- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE,- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.,- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.,- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.,- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good,- Received next day by 11 AM !,Not So Good:,- Not that thin, but ok.,- Doesn't have Samsung Dex,- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.,- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :),- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.,Feedback,- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.,- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.,Go for it without any doubt.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
,
  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.,Cons:,1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.,2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.,3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.,Pros:,1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.,2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.,3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.
,
  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.,64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.,Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.,Face unlock very slow.,Heat issue which charging and heavy usage,Full charge takes more than 3 hrs,Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone,go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality
,
  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.,Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.,However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.,So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.,Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.
,
  Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.
,
  Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB.

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-,Pro's,1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌,2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀,3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps,4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.,5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.,6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.,7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.,8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.,9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.,10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗,11. Supports OTG as well.,Cons,1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.,2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉,3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.,4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.,Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4,Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.
,
  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.
,
  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.,  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.,1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.,2. Smooth touch sensitivity,3. Ringtones are much louder.,4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.,5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.,6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.,7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.,8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.,8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.,  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.
,
  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.,By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.,We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".,Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.,  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.,-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.,What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.,Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

"Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Black (Includes EarPods, Power Adapter)","
  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.
,
  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.
,
  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
,
  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.,Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.,The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).,Cons:,1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.,2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.,Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).,But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .
,
  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.
,
  Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return  fast,Very very bad experience
,
  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

  First sell, First order. Mobile is very nice...

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.
,
  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.,But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.,Not recommended.,Would love to return but it was gift for family,

"OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","
  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.,I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.,The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.,The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.,Here are the issues:,1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).,2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.,3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.,4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.,5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.,6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.,I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.,I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.

  I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.,Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.,Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.,The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.,PROS:,CAMERA - 4.8/5,BATTERY- 5/5,Display - 4.7/5,Performance - 4.8/5,Speed - 5/5,Gaming experience- 4.8/5,CONS,NO Headset jack.,One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.,Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro),Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.
,
  My first one+7t & its make me so sad. I received the ph with manufacturing defect in display. Gum came out from the edges of display. How can a consumer aspects from a reputed brand after he paying 40000/- 🤔😭😟🥺😓
,
  This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones., What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?
,
  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.,HERE ARE MY CONCERNS,1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY,2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.,3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.,4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.,I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

And then I set, 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...,Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.., You can do that.. Its will not affect  battery,MONSTER :,1. Battery :- 5/5,Two day battery standby for normal easy,2.Display:- 4.99/5,Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display,3.Design:3/5,It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No,glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers,4. Camera: 3/5,Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..,5. OS&UI:- 5/5,Android 10 with One UI,6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5, Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast,7.Processor and performance 3.5/5,Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..,8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone,9. Accessories : 2/5,No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..,10.Loud speaker 1.5/5,Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones),Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...

  Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.,Highly Recommended phone 😊😊

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days,.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.,Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Defective product received, it gets 8 to 12 hours in charging and Amazon is not exchanging the product

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.
,
  Value for money.,I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.,I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.,But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.,As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.,iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.,The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!,Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.,I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.,I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.,But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.,My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.,And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.,Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India

  Thanks for Amazon service. phone is very nice and cool also is the display was very very cool the sound clarity is excellent and phone is very slim. And the processor is very fast Nice performance in gaming. Compare to other phones this is superb.

  My phone is not working since it has been arrived. Complain done atlest 10 times with the customer care but no positive response. I think i am wasted mine 38k. Amazon is a brand but still no response even they are constinusly saying that we cant do anything in this situation. VERY DISSAPOINETD THIS TIME.

  If you are an apple fan !! This is a true beauty to go for !!

  First of all one would want to know is the product genuine and not refurbished coz during Amazon Big Sale I got it for 35k.,Before unboxing the I checked up at Apple website and Online check with serial no , EMEI no and other details,And it was 100% genuine and new Handset.,Phone is working great,Delivery was also quick in 03 days ..

  Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.,But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.
,
  Please don't buy it.,It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know, from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.,You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.
,
  Product performance is poor.,Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.,Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.,Battery drains very fast.,Worst mobile performance.,Not even like Redmi Note 4.,Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.,I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.,Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

  Battery backup nyc and fast chariging back camera best but front camera good  nyc looking phone

  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  I waited a lot longer to get this phone. But thanks to Amazon that on its very first sale i got hold of one.,✓Camera,✓Battery,✓Big Display,✓Processor,✓Sound,✓User Interface.,✓Display Quality.

  Not satisfied with product,Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.,I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?

  The product is fine and working well. Battery and camera quality is phenomenal and met the expectations.  Unfortunately the Amazon promise on zero cost EMI is misleading. I opted for 6 months EMI considering zero percent interest. But HDFC bank charged me around 12% interest plus GST etc. This is like taking customer for a ride.  I was surprised to receive a msg like that from bank. Just to alert Amazon to rectify this immediately.

  Amazing product but I did not get head phone

  This is very good Phone.,I really like it.

  DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS MOBILE. On the very first day when I tried to start the handset , it didn't start and after a few times trying , it started. After a few minutes , it switched off by itself and wouldn't start. Right now I am running to and fro from the customer service of Vivo to get a replacement. SPARE YOURSELF OF ALL THIS TROUBLE BY NOT BUYING THIS MOBILE.

  Hey it's  genuine  phone with good features at this price point. But don't  expect too much from it like finger print and high end Camera.,Let it suffice  that the phone doesn't  hang at all and is pleasantly  smooth provided ur working on less apps.,👉 The processor is decent in this price range with definitely good battery life.,👉 There is exchange offer whr I replaced my old Lenovo K3 note which was lagging but has same Ram.,👉 The colour gives it a premium look and it less than 160gm which is less compared to heavy phones like redmi and Vivo U series. It is handy n slim at the same time.,👉Pictures and different language  support in text and typos is a welcome feature.,👉Overalll worth it at 7950 Rs. Nd exch worth 1500 or so.✋

  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.. Its barely 2 months since i have purchased this phone and its already giving me issues like the device is switching off and not turning on.  First time trying product from ViVo.. definitely not impressed. I see similar issues have been reported for this product.. shld have heeded their advice .. : |

"Honor 9A (Phantom Blue, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage)- Download Apps Through Petal Search","
  I gave 1 as there is no lower value than that.,Do not buy this mobile, please trust me you will regret if you buy.,NONE OF THE GOOGLE SERVICE APPS like youtube, gmail, gpay CAN BE INSTALLED ON THIS DEVICE.,Worst part is the other apps dependent on google play services also won't work like paytm, phonePe. Think about the games then.,You can't get backup from your old WhatsApp data to this device,Don't jumble yourself into the very tricky work around options to get those apps working.,Mobile is not attractive,Without the essential apps working with just battery and camera what are you going to do???,Beware and don't waste money on this mobile.,I wish somebody warned me before I purchase this cr@p
,
  I am very satisfied with this product in term of the design, battery, camera and all other hardware.,For the software, as we know, honor 9A  cannot run the Google Play Store and won’t fully work with Google services.,But thanks to the Huawei App Gallery and new devices’ Petal Search that lets you download Android apps from other sources, you should be able to get all of the apps you need. Especially for Petal Search, you can get it pre-installed post update of the system and you also can download from the App Gallery.,You can get almost all the daily app you need from petal search. What's app, Facebook Instagram can be obtained in the petal search easily. And you can also  utilize quick app and web version app to meet you demand.,I think you don't need worried about the software with the proper function of App Gallery and Petal search. And you can also call honor hotline for instruction. They are really helpful and professional.

  Honor 9

  dont buy .there is no playstore support or play services available ...you will regret..you will not be able to download any app.. the conflict is because of the dispute between china and america  dont buy it..you should buy  any redmi phone ..but dont buy this..and also this product is not returnable....
,
  It was my worst nightmare to use this phone. Since Google Apps are not supported, there are pretty much everything buggy in this phone. Absolutely piece of junk, not of any use other than taking pictures and receiving calls.,BUT, finally I was successful in returning the mobile; and I swear I would never buy anything from Huawei or Honor brand. For me, alternative choice of phone is either Redmi 9 or Redmi 9 Prime.
,
  The best Honor 9A phone I can buy in 2020 depends on your reliance on Google apps and services. Much like parent company Huawei, new Honor phones cannot run the Google Play Store and won’t fully work with Google services like your Google account.,But thanks to the Huawei App Gallery and new devices’ Petal Search that lets you download Android apps from other sources, you should be able to get all of the apps you need. Older Honor phones like the Honor View 20 at the top of this list still have the Play Store, so there’s no issue there.,Honor has a range of often blue phones at various price points, so there’s something for everyone and they often have the same specs and features as Huawei devices but at a cheaper cost. They also pack in decent camera features that are often aimed at a slightly younger audience, but like any Android phone they’ll work well in anyone’s pocket.,To make things easier here is our definitive ranking of the best Honor phones right now. Make sure to check out our full reviews of each one to see if they will be the right phone for you.,Really helpful phone for me to review and it's performance is very good and gave a great experience

  Dont have paly store /Google services... So the device is useless... Unable to run many apps which req daily usage...

  Honor 9a its good phone Value for Money...Good Looking & Display for smoothness, night moods, eye care, app is good, Huawei app gallery and petal search app is useful app downloading, Camera is not bad, battery backup is good, its 3GB & 64GB inbuilt memory, No problem handling game, After Sale Service is Good.,Purushothaman,Chennai

  First sell, First order. Mobile is very nice...

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.,But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.,Not recommended.,Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.,Pros:,Design and built quality - superb.,Display - Smoothness and view is very impressive,Finger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.,Rear camera - Good as considering the price.,Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.,Call quality very fine,Cons:,Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game,Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform,For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.,Macro camera - useless feature,Front camera - Average,Ui is fine but consuming more ram,Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).,Final,Normal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).,If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.,Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.,Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue.

So,choose your device wisely.

"Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","
  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.,BUILD QUALITY., Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.,DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.,With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.,BATTERY.,Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.,CAMERA.,This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.,PROCESSOR.,After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.,SOUND QUALITY.,After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.,Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.
,
  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.,All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.,Display is gorgeous.,Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.,FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.,Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs,6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).,The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.,Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??,M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.,The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.,Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.,Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.,Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.
,
   This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.
,
  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.,When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.,THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.,Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.,THANKS
,
  purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent service,about phone,used it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not working,tried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not working,replacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next one,never expected this quality from samsung
,
  Initial impression after using for one day.,1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device,2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this,3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.,4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about,5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.,6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery,7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-,Pro's,1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌,2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀,3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps,4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.,5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.,6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.,7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.,8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.,9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.,10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗,11. Supports OTG as well.,Cons,1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.,2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉,3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.,4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.,Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4,Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.
,
  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.
,
  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.,  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.,1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.,2. Smooth touch sensitivity,3. Ringtones are much louder.,4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.,5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.,6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.,7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.,8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.,8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.,  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.
,
  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.,By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.,We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".,Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.,  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.,-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.,What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.,Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days,.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.,Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.

  Value for money.,I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.,I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.,But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.,As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days,.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.,Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.
,
  Value for money.,I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.,I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.,But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.,As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

  Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor.

  NEVER BUY OPPO. This phone is just a wastage of money, if you are going to buy this phone then change your decision because it will not provide cost on which you will buy it. You should buy SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 instead of going with any other brand phone in the budget segment under 15k. You will get best performance, camera, battery, display, overall everything better than oppo. Nothing new in oppo a53 other than 90 Hz refresh rate. Oppo never provide value for money product.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.,Good:,- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!,- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.,- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.,- 6000 Mah battery is BIG,- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.,- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE,- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.,- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.,- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.

Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.,- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
,
  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.,Cons:,1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.,2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.,3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.,Pros:,1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.,2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.,3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.
,
  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.,64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.,Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.,Face unlock very slow.,Heat issue which charging and heavy usage,Full charge takes more than 3 hrs,Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone,go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.,Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.,However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.,So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.,Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

"TECNO Spark 6 Air (Ocean Blue, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","
  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.,Pros,Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days,Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing),Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot,Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash,Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use,Cons,Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)

  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.

  Easily the best specifications at 7999.,Was planning to get Spark Power 2.,But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.

  Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.,But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.
,
  Please don't buy it.,It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know, from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.,You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.
,
  Product performance is poor.,Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.,Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.,Battery drains very fast.,Worst mobile performance.,Not even like Redmi Note 4.,Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.,I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.,Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

  Battery backup nyc and fast chariging back camera best but front camera good  nyc looking phone
,
  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  I waited a lot longer to get this phone. But thanks to Amazon that on its very first sale i got hold of one.,✓Camera,✓Battery,✓Big Display,✓Processor,✓Sound,✓User Interface.,✓Display Quality.

  Not satisfied with product,Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.,I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.
,
  Value for money.,I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.,I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.,But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.,As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  There are lot of better phones available at the market.  I guess its way too late to launch this product at this time as it's time of quad camera📷 and hd screen and better battery.  The phone is too pricy for the current trend📈

  Under this price the mobile was good enough. Camera good, light weight mobile,hd screen and with Google assistant.if u r searching for mobile under 10000 just go for it.

"Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","
  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.,BUILD QUALITY., Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.,DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.,With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.,BATTERY.,Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.,CAMERA.,This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.,PROCESSOR.,After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.,SOUND QUALITY.,After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.,Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.
,
  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.,All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.,Display is gorgeous.,Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.,FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.,Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs,6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).,The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.,Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??,M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.,The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.,Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.,Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.,Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.
,
   This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.
,
  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.,When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.,THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.,Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.,THANKS
,
  purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent service,about phone,used it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not working,tried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not working,replacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next one,never expected this quality from samsung
,
  Initial impression after using for one day.,1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device,2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this,3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.,4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about,5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.,6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery,7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

"Redmi 9A (Sea Blue, 2Gb Ram, 32Gb Storage)","
  Hello. The Redmi 9 A phone I bought is fine. I know Redmi will always be the best. Because I have been a Redmi customer for about 5 1/2 years. My first Redmi phone was the Redmi 2 Prime. But the Redmi 9 A phone I just bought has been opened by the seller. The lamination cover of the box was peeled off. The sealing sticker on both sides of the box was disassembled and then pasted.I did not send this phone back as I do not want to return the Redmi phone and it is difficult to get the phone on flash sale. I would like to sever the Amazon relationship with this. It was a very bad experience for me. good bye Amazon.
,
  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.,If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.,On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.,Phone is light weight with a good look
,
  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really good,After one week use,Edit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.

   Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GB,Things I like:,* Big Display which is well lit,* Light weight,* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern,* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating),* Camera is above average,* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12),* USB-C & Headphone jack,* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF,* No bloatwares except Google apps,* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gestures,Things I didn't liked:,* Camera performance in low light,* Screen ratio (bit longer),* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+),* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range),In the box:,* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.,Conclusion:,It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).,This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.,Go for it, you'll be happy.,Note: Charger is ""Made in China""
,
  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.,Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for.
,
  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:,> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.,> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.,> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.,Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.,The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.,There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.,> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.,> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.,> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.,Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.,Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

  Loving the phone....Purchased with bank discount,6gb 128gb blue variant...i must say,it looks super awesome....,having gorilla glass protection in front and back,it makes it even better....,Camera is really cool,getting some decent clicks,just install google camera and the quality is much much better,Battery backup is quite good as well,just turn off dual 4g,dont use volte if not necessary,turn of auto start for apps which u feel are not required,keep miui battery saver turned on for better backup,keep gps off when not needed,just do small adjustments and battery will surely last longer,Performance is also great considering the chipset you are getting,infact u also get 4g+ which is not even there on redmi note 7 pro and would never come also....so internet speed,call quality,signal strength...everything is impressive,I must say,in this price range,this phone totally deserves praises from all....i hope i tried to cover all points and helped people to look for this phone as a good option for them...All the best...

  Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.,But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.
,
  Please don't buy it.,It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know, from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.,You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.
,
  Product performance is poor.,Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.,Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.,Battery drains very fast.,Worst mobile performance.,Not even like Redmi Note 4.,Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.,I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.,Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  I waited a lot longer to get this phone. But thanks to Amazon that on its very first sale i got hold of one.,✓Camera,✓Battery,✓Big Display,✓Processor,✓Sound,✓User Interface.,✓Display Quality.

  Not satisfied with product,Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.,I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max.

  In display lines started coming after using 1 day . I want to return this . Amazon Customer service is worst. Though damage is visible they are not accepting for return.

  Bought for my mother but callers repeatedly complained of choppy/unclear voice. I was certain that my handset has a defective microphone. Raised case with Amazon and they happily assisted with return and refund. 5 Stars to Amazon for support. But zero stars to Samsung. 2 days back I went to local market and again saw this device. Shopkeeper assured me of perfect functioning device but I did a test call and again caller complained of choppy audio. Prospective buyers please be aware of some potential issue with microphone clarity.

  Its Fantastico.,Exquisite.,Premium design,Excellent built quality.,Processor is average snapdragon 450.,Best phone in budget segment.,Go for this.,Reliability = Samsung.

  Super phone the in hand feeling is awesome,it's camera is best in this budget segment and the 5000 mah battery is humongous. And I am happy to buy a non-chiniese phone.

  Superr

  What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body,... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!,You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...,I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋,  - Real Fact
,
  Looks are awesome, handling is quite interesting as it has android 10, Camera Good, front camera is best in all, battery is good. I just got delivery of this phone. I will write a review after 2 months again to update
,
  Good for those who aren't gamer or like to play games or it is specialy for our parent's  because i also purchased for my mother.,*CONS*,~Its has very low chipset that is SD450.,~FRONT CAMERA IS VERY POOR.,~IT DON'T COMES WITH ANY TEMPERED OR COVER,~THE LENGTH OF DATA CABLE IS VERY SHORT (70inc.) Normally the length is 1m. So it is very short and thin.

  Febulas performance Redmi Note 8 ...I love it ..😍,first time I parchase online and Amazon give full satisfaction of product.,Thanks for Amazon 😘

   Phone hanged many times .I return it for replacement but not get back yet.Amazon shipping and replacement service is too bad. I uploaded a video....
,
  Loving the phone....Purchased with bank discount,6gb 128gb blue variant...i must say,it looks super awesome....,having gorilla glass protection in front and back,it makes it even better....,Camera is really cool,getting some decent clicks,just install google camera and the quality is much much better,Battery backup is quite good as well,just turn off dual 4g,dont use volte if not necessary,turn of auto start for apps which u feel are not required,keep miui battery saver turned on for better backup,keep gps off when not needed,just do small adjustments and battery will surely last longer,Performance is also great considering the chipset you are getting,infact u also get 4g+ which is not even there on redmi note 7 pro and would never come also....so internet speed,call quality,signal strength...everything is impressive,I must say,in this price range,this phone totally deserves praises from all....i hope i tried to cover all points and helped people to look for this phone as a good option for them...All the best...

  A empresa não é indicada, fazem anúncios do produto na plataforma, emitem nota exatamente igual está no anúncio, mas na hora que entrega o produto é inferior, e ainda debocham da nossa cara, falando que não trabalham com o produto.,Comprei um celular xiaomi note 8 128 GB com 6 RAM, Mas me entregaram outro com 4 RAM.,Absurdo!!! Propaganda enganosa...

  El celular tiene cerios problemas de conectividad no puedes hacer nada inalámbrica mente ya que a cada segundo te desconecta de wifi o del 4g, aclaro ese es el problema del que me enviaron.

  El wifi no funciona , va y viene así tengas el modem a un lado de el , ví que con otro usuario tenían el mismo error , quedaron de llamarme para darme asesoría técnica pero no lo hicieron , en definitiva lo devolveré .

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.

   Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GB,Things I like:,* Big Display which is well lit,* Light weight,* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern,* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating),* Camera is above average,* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12),* USB-C & Headphone jack,* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF,* No bloatwares except Google apps,* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gestures,Things I didn't liked:,* Camera performance in low light,* Screen ratio (bit longer),* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+),* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range),In the box:,* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.,Conclusion:,It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).,This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.,Go for it, you'll be happy.,Note: Charger is ""Made in China""
,
  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.,Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for.
,
  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:,> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.,> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.,> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.,Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.,The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.,There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.,> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.,> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.,> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.,Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.,Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

"Tecno Spark 6 Air (Comet Black, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","
  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.,Pros,Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days,Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing),Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot,Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash,Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use,Cons,Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)
,
  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.
,
  Easily the best specifications at 7999.,Was planning to get Spark Power 2.,But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.

  The battery life is good but doesn't contains a Fast Charger,even the storage is spacious. The Camera quality is fine and totally meets the expectation. The overall phone is nice but not strong enough to handle highly specified apps, like we can easily notice the lags while scrolling up/down in the YouTube trending and Instagram surfing threads. The frame rate has already been dropped. So, won't be able to access PUBG or COD not more than Low graphics and Medium FPS even the response is slower (as if playing Devil May Cry 4 in AMD Athlon processor attached PC)

  Product is very excellent. I am pleased with your service. Product was delivered before the given time. Very fast delivery.

  I want to buy low priced featured smartphone and found this and I didn't regret my purchase.,It has great features at given price (5150 RS) in fact best phone to offer such features at price in current time.,Screen: not best if you use Samsung amoled display or premium brand products but definitely its great at price. Touch, screen quality is good and won't regret.,Performance: It's do job fantastic if you use for basic phone features, surfing and multiple tab is also good. I didn't feel any lagging. Performance is as good as xiaomi likes products.,Battery : battery is just okay doesn't have much to offer. Battery life is not so great and hardly last for day If 4g data and location is on as it has only 2400 mAH capacity. Best part is its removable battery so could be easy to change in future if required.,Charging is liitle slow and take much time to charge - no fast charging. It has micro USB ports.,Fingerprint is very good responsive and face unlock works great. Face unlock capabilities is appreciable.,Box includes phone, removable battery, charger, already applied Screen cover and TPU back cover with warranty card.,If you OK with battery and have budget friendly smartphone then suggest this is best phone to choose.

  Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.,But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.
,
  Please don't buy it.,It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know, from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.,You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.

  Product performance is poor.,Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.,Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.,Battery drains very fast.,Worst mobile performance.,Not even like Redmi Note 4.,Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.,I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.,Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

  guys beware wifi doesn't work when you lock your phone for 10min. again when u unlock it it works. seriously issue.  redmi should work upon

  Battery backup nyc and fast chariging back camera best but front camera good  nyc looking phone

  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  I waited a lot longer to get this phone. But thanks to Amazon that on its very first sale i got hold of one.,✓Camera,✓Battery,✓Big Display,✓Processor,✓Sound,✓User Interface.,✓Display Quality.

  Not satisfied with product,Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.,I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?

  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.,Pros:,Design and built quality - superb.,Display - Smoothness and view is very impressive,Finger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.,Rear camera - Good as considering the price.,Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.,Call quality very fine,Cons:,Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game,Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform,For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.,Macro camera - useless feature,Front camera - Average,Ui is fine but consuming more ram,Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).,Final,Normal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).,If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.,Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.,Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤

  Awesome product 💎,Value for money 💵,Best in segment📱,For normal usage this one is the best 🙌,Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.,Camera is ok for this price📸,Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕, Overall its best for the price  👍

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.

  Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-,Pro's,1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌,2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀,3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps,4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.,5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.,6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.,7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.,8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.,9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.,10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗,11. Supports OTG as well.,Cons,1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.,2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉,3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.,4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.,Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4,Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.
,
  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.
,
  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.,  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.,1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.,2. Smooth touch sensitivity,3. Ringtones are much louder.,4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.,5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.,6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.,7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.,8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.,8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.,  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.
,
  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.,By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.,We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".,Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.,  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.,-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.,What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.,Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Hey it's  genuine  phone with good features at this price point. But don't  expect too much from it like finger print and high end Camera.,Let it suffice  that the phone doesn't  hang at all and is pleasantly  smooth provided ur working on less apps.,👉 The processor is decent in this price range with definitely good battery life.,👉 There is exchange offer whr I replaced my old Lenovo K3 note which was lagging but has same Ram.,👉 The colour gives it a premium look and it less than 160gm which is less compared to heavy phones like redmi and Vivo U series. It is handy n slim at the same time.,👉Pictures and different language  support in text and typos is a welcome feature.,👉Overalll worth it at 7950 Rs. Nd exch worth 1500 or so.✋

  The hardware of the phone lives up to its specifications until now. 4GB RAM makes it snappy, 64GB internal storage gives you over 50GB unused space to start with, battery good for 1.5 days of basic use, gaming surprisingly is decent in medium settings, and camera okay-ish. The downside is the UI, not intuitive and looks a little old. Can be fixed if you change the ROM, but that will take time.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.,Good:,- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!,- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.,- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.,- 6000 Mah battery is BIG,- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.,- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE,- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.,- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.,- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.,- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good,- Received next day by 11 AM !,Not So Good:,- Not that thin, but ok.,- Doesn't have Samsung Dex,- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.,- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :),- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.,Feedback,- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.,- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.,Go for it without any doubt.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
,
  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.,Cons:,1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.,2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.,3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.,Pros:,1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.,2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.,3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.
,
  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.,64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.,Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.,Face unlock very slow.,Heat issue which charging and heavy usage,Full charge takes more than 3 hrs,Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone,go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality
,
  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.,Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.,However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.,So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.,Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

And you can also  utilize quick app and web version app to meet you demand.,I think you don't need worried about the software with the proper function of App Gallery and Petal search. And you can also call honor hotline for instruction. They are really helpful and professional.

  dont buy .there is no playstore support or play services available ...you will regret..you will not be able to download any app.. the conflict is because of the dispute between china and america  dont buy it..you should buy  any redmi phone ..but dont buy this..and also this product is not returnable....
,
  It was my worst nightmare to use this phone. Since Google Apps are not supported, there are pretty much everything buggy in this phone. Absolutely piece of junk, not of any use other than taking pictures and receiving calls.,BUT, finally I was successful in returning the mobile; and I swear I would never buy anything from Huawei or Honor brand. For me, alternative choice of phone is either Redmi 9 or Redmi 9 Prime.
,
  The best Honor 9A phone I can buy in 2020 depends on your reliance on Google apps and services. Much like parent company Huawei, new Honor phones cannot run the Google Play Store and won’t fully work with Google services like your Google account.,But thanks to the Huawei App Gallery and new devices’ Petal Search that lets you download Android apps from other sources, you should be able to get all of the apps you need. Older Honor phones like the Honor View 20 at the top of this list still have the Play Store, so there’s no issue there.,Honor has a range of often blue phones at various price points, so there’s something for everyone and they often have the same specs and features as Huawei devices but at a cheaper cost. They also pack in decent camera features that are often aimed at a slightly younger audience, but like any Android phone they’ll work well in anyone’s pocket.,To make things easier here is our definitive ranking of the best Honor phones right now. Make sure to check out our full reviews of each one to see if they will be the right phone for you.,Really helpful phone for me to review and it's performance is very good and gave a great experience

  Dont have paly store /Google services... So the device is useless... Unable to run many apps which req daily usage...

  Honor 9a its good phone Value for Money...Good Looking & Display for smoothness, night moods, eye care, app is good, Huawei app gallery and petal search app is useful app downloading, Camera is not bad, battery backup is good, its 3GB & 64GB inbuilt memory, No problem handling game, After Sale Service is Good.,Purushothaman,Chennai

  Redmi say desh ka smartphone.. but what really this mobile is desh ka smartphone,Don't buy it's not worthy,Size: quite tiny. If you like big screen might be u won't like screen.,Display : decent IPS panel . No expected much at this price range.,Performance:  2gb ram can't even play pubg or high end game in low setting. Only for daily routine and parents user.,Storage: emmc type so read write also slow.,Camera: decent can't say more,Price: I might say after using few days it's over price. May be 6k or below for base version but I disappointed really 😔
,
  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.,* Looks beautiful and elegant.,*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.,*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.,* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.,*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.,*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.,*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent,**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery.
,
  Points to be noted:,👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.,👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.,👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.,👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.,👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone.

  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked price,Mi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.,Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.,Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.,Need Improvement.,Processor is best for browsering , social networking,This processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.,Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say., brightness level is good and it also handle with sun., Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses
,
  Best phone you can get at this segment totally worth the amount you are paying
,
  Best phone @6800 Rs.,Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.,Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.,But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best.

  Lovely phon.& very very hote.ilove that phone.no any problems but Ram 2gb no at least 3GB Ram.

  It has Chinese OS, which is know for sharing the prsonal information and installing all fake apps in the phone. Be extremely careful with these low budget chinese phones.
,
  Good mobile under 8k.,First of all I would like to tell you that buy back value of tecno mobiles at amazon is far better.,Built quality is good. Screen size is very big and screen quality is very good. Design looks cool.,Camera is satisfactory according to the budget.,RAM is only for normal use.,SOUND level and qualit is good.,This mobile is MADE IN INDIA.,One can go for it, if budget is tight. Overall recommended in this price range.
,
  Battery life Too good .,Screen quality excellent and perfect touch .,Can open multiple apps that we use in daily life and ram management is excellent.,In hand feel premium and balanced even though it has high battery.,Rear camera after update works perfectly in day light for indoor photos must use flash and belive me it has too strong quad flash that makes photos great in indoor.,For gaming high graphics games like pubg it is not suitable . Overall Too beautiful look with battery and dot in display type make the phone value for money . For normal user whatsapp facebook insta u never feel u using 2 gb ram phone .

  Design and Looks are great at this price , Screen size , Battery and punchhole camera  are  ""WOW THINGS""  however resolutions is not that much good .,For movies and all this is the best phone to have at this price  but yes you have to sacrifice with performance ., 2 GB RAM is not going to be  enough for you if you are a ""GAMER "" .This phone can do day to day task very well but not able to run pubg and any other game with that much smoothness needed to enjoy the game .,Ok so let's talk about CAMERA,Camera is also up to mark .At this price you will get an average camera which it have even it have many other options like wide angle , AI beauty and all which you will not get in every phone at this price .,Every thing is good the only thing which annoys is its processor and ram which makes it equall to other phones at this price .,Yes processor is really really outdated amd ram is also low making this phone a low end device .,but inspite of this its a great budget phone .

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

"Xifo Kenxinda S9 4G Smartphone (2GB RAM, 16GB Storage) in Grey in 5.2 inch Touchscreen",
"Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","
  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.,BUILD QUALITY., Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.,DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.,With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.,BATTERY.,Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.,CAMERA.,This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.,PROCESSOR.,After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.,SOUND QUALITY.,After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.,Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.
,
  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.,All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.,Display is gorgeous.,Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.,FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.,Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs,6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).,The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.,Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??,M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.,The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.,Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.,Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.,Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.
,
   This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.
,
  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.,When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.,THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.,Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.,THANKS
,
  purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent service,about phone,used it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not working,tried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not working,replacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next one,never expected this quality from samsung
,
  Initial impression after using for one day.,1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device,2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this,3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.,4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about,5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.,6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery,7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  Please don't buy it.,It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know, from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.,You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.
,
  Product performance is poor.,Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.,Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.,Battery drains very fast.,Worst mobile performance.,Not even like Redmi Note 4.,Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.,I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.,Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  I waited a lot longer to get this phone. But thanks to Amazon that on its very first sale i got hold of one.,✓Camera,✓Battery,✓Big Display,✓Processor,✓Sound,✓User Interface.,✓Display Quality.

  Not satisfied with product,Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.,I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?

  A reasonably decent mobile. Overall an extremely good mobile. Gifted to my mother. Not sure if someone is camera Creek, then how they would take it, as that was not my criteria.

Good battery, stays up to more than 1 day upon routine use. Light weight. Dont compare it with high end mobiles though.

  I purchased this phone online from Amazon... since the day I purchased it, it never worked properly... i updated the operating system, i updated all the software and with all this the performance even degraded and started hanging.

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 3 Months No Cost EMI on BFL","
  Don’t buy this product .,Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.,And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .,DON’T buy this mobile
,
  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing,🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 ,Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.,🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 ,The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.,🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈,The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?,🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰,There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

  i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .,1.display 4/5,2.cam 3/5,3.fing sens.. 4.5/5,4.processor 3/5,5.build quality 3.75/5,back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinion,in this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
,
  Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues.

   It just arrived yesterday. First view I love it so much. Beautiful phone with nice speed. No lag, all are working properly. Only issue is that, unable to finding the back cover and tempered glass from online & need more battery. I feel so proud to see even charger also made in India. Edited: After months use i am satisfied with this product.I have purchased temp glass & back cover from online.
,
  Only problem is battery small and camera quality is moderat otherwise is very good mobile. But first step towards #MakeindiaProud
,
  It has been two weeks since the phone is purchase and its really worth for the money. On par with any of the Chinese competitors like Redmi 8A or Realme C3. Certainly worth buying definitely you wont regret.,Will wait and see how Indian player launch their phone models in the heavy lifting segment i.e. 10-12K..
,
  It is the best product at this price.,I liked following features:,1. It has nice look,2. It has decent camera,3. Did not lag even when I was using multiple apps simultaneously,4. Above all it is Made In India, which drove me crazy about it.,#ProudlyIndian,#VocalForLocal
,
  Display is very good and nice to watch videos in you tube. Camera quality is also good. Took a selfie , it came out well. Purchased mainly for making calls and watching you tube. It serves both purposes. Finger print is very slow. No bloat ware like redmi phone. We are using redmi 7a which has lot of bloatware. This is a very clean phone. Only useful apps preinstalled. Battery is also lasting for almost 2 days on full charging. It is also getting charged fully in 30 minutes. Company priced it competitively. Very happy that an indian brand has done such a nice job. Worth buying. I recommend this phone if your requirements are simple for every day use. Speaker sound is also good.
,
  This phone has a lot going for it.,- For starters no annoying advertisements.,- Very bright good screen.,- Surprisingly good Haptic Engine,- Phone does basics good Calling, Hotspot, Wifi .,- 3GB RAM,- Battery becomes good after 5-7 days of usage (6 hours SOT light use),- Android 10, fully stock. The best software experience.,Cons,- Camera is weak, waiting for G-Cam.,- No Noise Cancellation mic.,- Speakers are not that great.,- Plastic back,- No gyroscope.,All in all very good phone for the price. Makes all the right compromises.
,
  This is my 3 days usage review. I have purchased this phone in Rs.8229/-. This is best phone in this range. No lagging, running smoothly. Also camera is good. Also battery backup is good. If anyone want to buy this phone please go ahead without any hesitation. This is made in India phone. Overall Good as compared to other Chinese phones. There is addition security feature that I have noticed. Finger scanner unlock requires pattern if you want to unlock phone after couple of hours.

  I had purchased lava z66,marine blue..I had received mobile phone at evening and switch it on but the next day it suddenly got switched of or blank while using. I tried to charge for 3hrs but still dosent got switched on..I had file return for it but technician didn't visit to my place and updated that issue is resolved. I had again complain for same but 1week had passed after the 2nd complain still issue isn't resolved regarding replace or return of my mobile phone.

  Awesome mobile at this price point
,
  I simply liked it when i unboxed it and saw it at first glance. Its 16.15 cms display is quite impressive. Most of the time i watch movies while travelling to and from office . Hence I can have a better screen view now. The camera is also excellent.,Overall a nice phone within a nominal budget. I’ll give it a 5 stars for now.
,
  I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it’s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.,It’s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo “Camera & Music” it really impressed me.,I’ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..,Pros:-,● It’s really a 100% value for money device.,● Run on latest version of Android “9”.,● In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.,● Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids,● Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.,● 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video,● HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes,● Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me,● Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor,● Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitasking,Cons:-,● Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it’s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space),● No headphones included,● Front Camera struggles in low light.,At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.,I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!

  The device is too heavy don't go for it. Also it lags a lot despite having a Snapdragon processor of 600 series with 3gb 64 gb storage.

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

"Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","
  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.,BUILD QUALITY., Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.,DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.,With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.,BATTERY.,Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.,CAMERA.,This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.,PROCESSOR.,After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.,SOUND QUALITY.,After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.,Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.
,
  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.,All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.,Display is gorgeous.,Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.,FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.,Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs,6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).,The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.,Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??,M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.,The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.,Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.,Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.,Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.
,
   This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.
,
  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.,When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.,THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.,Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.,THANKS
,
  purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent service,about phone,used it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not working,tried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not working,replacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next one,never expected this quality from samsung
,
  Initial impression after using for one day.,1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device,2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this,3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.,4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about,5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.,6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery,7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.,Good:,- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!,- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.,- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.,- 6000 Mah battery is BIG,- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.,- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE,- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.,- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.,- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.,- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good,- Received next day by 11 AM !,Not So Good:,- Not that thin, but ok.,- Doesn't have Samsung Dex,- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.,- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :),- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.,Feedback,- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.,- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.,Go for it without any doubt.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
,
  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.,Cons:,1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.,2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.,3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.,Pros:,1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.,2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.,3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.
,
  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.,64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.,Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.,Face unlock very slow.,Heat issue which charging and heavy usage,Full charge takes more than 3 hrs,Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone,go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality
,
  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.,Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.,However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.,So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.,Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.

  Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  .

  Pros:,1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.,2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.,3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.,4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons),5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.,6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances),7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.,8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.,9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast),Cons:,1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised),2) No headphone jack.,3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.,4) No expandable memory slot.,5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.,6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.,Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.,But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.,Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably),Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.

  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.
,
  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....,Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....,Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...,INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:,No tint issue which has been widely reported.,Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.,Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.,Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures,, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...,Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.,Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....
,
  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:,• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.,•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.,•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅,•Premium user-experience.,•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.,•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.,•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.,Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️,*UPDATED*,•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour),•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.,•No serious heating issues at all.,•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.,•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)

  So, I ended up ordering this for my mother. I think I am going to keep it for myself.,So far so good, 1st day of usage-,If we say that One Plus and Iphones are 9/10s or 10/10s then Oppo F17 Pro is-,Battery Charging Capacity- 8/10,Battery Lasting Capacity- 8/10,Rear Camera- 8/10,Front Camera- 8/10,Screen- 9/10,Sound- 9/10,Comes with a cover, ear phones and a charger which is indeed amazing.,The phone is surprisingly good. It has a good camera which has multiple modes to click photos. It's front camera is top notch. I think if you get this phone for less than 20k by exchanging your old phone, it is totally worth it.,It is a very light phone btw. Easy on the eyes and easy on the pocket.,This is a day 1 review, first impression and a few hours of usage after full battery. It charges real quick btw.,Shall update and edit this review in future if anything changes.,Oppo has caught up with One Plus phones and with this budget phone, it has moved a step ahead.,Buy it without any regrets if you can exchange an old phone and get this within 20,000.,Go for it.
,
  My initial thoughts of the product,Design 5/5 - it is great to see a brand put emphasis on design aspect of phone, it is sleek and light - great to hold,Camera 5/5- the dual front camera at this price is good, the best part about both cameras was the color portrait with black and white background,Charging and battery 5/5 - charging was really fast and I am satisfied with the 30w charging.,Performance 5/5- the display and performance of the phone is also really good.
,
  The phone is sleek and very handy. Having 8gb of RAM is the best thing, the phone is fast, responsive. The only thing that I felt Oppo could have made better was the front camera. It not only feels that images captured are artificial but also have very less details captured. Overall the phone battery life is very good, quad camera produces top quality images. I will give this phone 4.5 rating...

  I had ordered this phone on the launch day and I received it on 10th September. After 2 days of usage My detailed review,Pros :,1) Very Light and very slim,2) 30Watt VOOC charge which charges phone in less than an hour,3) Display,4) Battery Backup ( not a gamer ),5) Rear Quad Camera has separate separate lens cover for each lens which makes easy for replacing lens cover later.,Cons :,1) I think Camera is not up to the mark,2) Editing options are very less even though AI is there.,3) Charging adapter is too heavy of course it's a 30watt charger,4) Finger print sensor response is low,Conclusion :,I love this phone coz it's really very very light and slim and I am not a gamer and I am not a heavy camera user. So For camera lovers and Gamers this I don't recommend this phone. But others who just love slim phone, just buy this phone. It's really awesome however camera is good but not the best. So think and buy.
,
  It is good phone but not best in this price range as it is not value for money product. It has 4 cameras in rear but 2 cameras are just good for nothing. Oppo just showed to customer that they are giving 4 cameras in rear. Phone back is totally plastic whih may get impacted in case of any fall. Processer can be snapdragon but they are offering mediatek. Now focus on some postive things where design in amazing. Phone has amoled display which makes it perfect in its category. Screen size, ram,memory, battery are great.

  Good one under 9k, Detailed review after using a week
,
  A reasonably decent mobile. Overall an extremely good mobile. Gifted to my mother. Not sure if someone is camera Creek, then how they would take it, as that was not my criteria. I liked the mobile being already seen and handled One plus 7T and Samsung M31. This is a good one in 8990 bucks.,Update: Working fine even after 2 odd months. Good battery, stays up to more than 1 day upon routine use. Light weight. Dont compare it with high end mobiles though.
,
  Product is only valubale for calling and browing ,apart from that it is not able to handle high backup apps.even it got hanged when iam using facebook app.,So kindly look before you buy ,regaring the data you are going to handle on this mobile .
,
  I purchased this phone online from Amazon... since the day I purchased it, it never worked properly... i updated the operating system, i updated all the software and with all this the performance even degraded and started hanging. I did Factory Reset but the phone keep hanging on and goes Black-out in between any application.,The phone is a very cheap quality and horrible product. the ratings on the website are fake and misleading. Now after 8 days even the vendor has disagreed to replace it.
,
  It is a budget and decent smartphone. But it has little slow performance as compared to other budget smartphone in this price segment. Overall performance is good. Camera could more better as compared with other smartphone.
,
  Productis very nice but iam exange realme,Same model this item,Iam realme exange after one month

  Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.,2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ।l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir।,3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.,4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.,5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .,Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.
,
  i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.,it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is larger,display is on par with iphone x,music sounded as good as iphone x,i could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. 😄,Also the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.,dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.,quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.
,
  So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.,1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.,2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.,3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility,4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.,5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm,6. Build Material quality is good.,7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.,8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.,9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.,10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming),11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.,Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.

  Really great phone....Dont think too much ....just go for it....honest review!!!
,
  Last week I exchanged M01s for my existing M10. M01s screen is larger in size than M01 and very much resembles the M10.,Camera quality is very good and so is battery power. Battery lasted me 1.25 days on moderate to heavy use. I take about2 hrs for mobile to charge.,Memory of 3GB is good for videos, online calls without any lag. I am not a avid games user.,Most amazing is the blue coloured. It has a metallic look and looks very nice. Iwasntsurewhen I ordered.
,
  My first experience samsung brand
,
  i am disappointed because of the two thing,1.fast charging options is not provided,2.this is not 4g phone they have provided LTE mode,as we all are looking for 5G phone and Samsung is not providing with at least 4g technology in 2020 era in 10K,then it will not be acceptable from the customer
,
  Slow system
,
  Good performance and light in weight.  Rear and front Camera resolution is good. Charger is thin pin.,Decent battery life. Of all it is manufactured in India.
,
  Overall mobile is good but seems slow and less memory 32 GB and battary 4000 mh only, in comparison to other mobiles available in the market at this price. However, being samsung mobile made in India bought it.

  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...,Pros.,1) good features considering cost 6800.,2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt,3) Speakers are good Dolby,4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...,5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...,6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800,7) 5000mAh battery,8) can be use as power bank for other phones,Cons:,1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...,2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...,This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...
,
  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,,Review score (out of 5),Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...,Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor),Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.,Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.,Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours),Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available,Pros : apart from above mentioned points :,1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung),2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.,3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly,4)face detection is fast,5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming,6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses,Cons:,1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high,2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option,3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro,4) no fast charger with pack
,
  Good Phone With Exchange
,
  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...,But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...,Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..,Thanks Oppo
,
  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge
,
  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?
,
  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device
,
  Pros- Phone looks actually good,  Good battery life,Cons- phone is too heavy,  Camera performance not upto the,  mark.,Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

  Bought for my mother but callers repeatedly complained of choppy/unclear voice. I was certain that my handset has a defective microphone. Raised case with Amazon and they happily assisted with return and refund. 5 Stars to Amazon for support. But zero stars to Samsung. 2 days back I went to local market and again saw this device. Shopkeeper assured me of perfect functioning device but I did a test call and again caller complained of choppy audio.

  What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body,... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!,You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...,I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋,  - Real Fact

  Good for those who aren't gamer or like to play games or it is specialy for our parent's  because i also purchased for my mother.,*CONS*,~Its has very low chipset that is SD450.,~FRONT CAMERA IS VERY POOR.,~IT DON'T COMES WITH ANY TEMPERED OR COVER,~THE LENGTH OF DATA CABLE IS VERY SHORT (70inc.)

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

  Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor.

  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.,Pros:,Design and built quality - superb.,Display - Smoothness and view is very impressive,Finger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.,Rear camera - Good as considering the price.,Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.,Call quality very fine,Cons:,Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game,Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform,For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.,Macro camera - useless feature,Front camera - Average,Ui is fine but consuming more ram,Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).,Final,Normal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).,If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.,Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.,Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤

  Awesome product 💎,Value for money 💵,Best in segment📱,For normal usage this one is the best 🙌,Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.,Camera is ok for this price📸,Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕, Overall its best for the price  👍
,
  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.

  Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge.

PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)

  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.

  Easily the best specifications at 7999.,Was planning to get Spark Power 2.,But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.

  Price is too high for this specifications. 11000-12000 is the perfect price. Other than everything is fine
,
  Reliable phone with neat experience. Zero bloatware.,Even though it's a 12 MP cam, the quality of photos and top notch.,Battery keeps us for 2 days as well - good software optimization.,The build quality is a good as the ones in 25k+ prices for other phones.,Perfect everyday use phone!

  I have nokia 7.2,i dont have this phone,,,but still i love it.....because i am a nokia lover..... 😊
,
  Stock Android - Clean OS without any bloatware, 2 Years of promised Android OS & Security Updates, Elegant Design which is super cool compared with Nokia 7.2, Very Smooth and Sturdy in holding the handset & On a Final Verdict - Awesome Deal for Android One Lovers 😊.,Promised one day delivery by Appario 😊.

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.
,
   Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GB,Things I like:,* Big Display which is well lit,* Light weight,* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern,* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating),* Camera is above average,* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12),* USB-C & Headphone jack,* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF,* No bloatwares except Google apps,* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gestures,Things I didn't liked:,* Camera performance in low light,* Screen ratio (bit longer),* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+),* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range),In the box:,* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.,Conclusion:,It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).,This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.,Go for it, you'll be happy.,Note: Charger is ""Made in China""
,
  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.,Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for.
,
  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:,> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.,> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.,> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.,Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.,The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.,There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.,> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.,> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.,> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.,Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.,Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

"Panasonic Eluga i7 (2GB RAM, 16GB Storage, Finger Print Sensor, 4000mAh Battery) (Black)","
  Okk I am writing a review after using one day ..,I gifted this mobile to my mother and she liked a lot ..,First of all I let you know this is an updated version of Eluga I7..as you can check on the pictures posted by me ..it's Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition..,And this is updated to Android 9.0 pie..,Whereas the Normal Version is only Android 7 version( which is available on Flipkart).,This mobile does not have tray SIM slot..rather you can open the back cover and easily insert both the SIM and Memory card..and  has Non Hybrid Sim Slots..But point to note here is SIM 1 is Micro and SIM 2 Nano ..,Camera quality is gud not so gorgeous with 8MP for both Front and Back ..with Flash Led lights on both sides..you can't expect more in this price range .,The best thing is it's Battery Back up of 4000 MAH..,Videos run smooth you tube and all.,You can increase the Storage space .. accordingly.,Doesn't support quick charging so it takes time for charging but the battery backup is worth .,My Verdict would be if you are getting so many features fr a price of 6499 ..it's worth buying ..,A thumbs up from me.👍👍👍
,
  good
,
  Phone Hangs even during playing YouTube. Hangs even during using camera. Update worsen the situation.,Finger Touch unlock is not working after one month.
,
  Had purchased an older model of Panasonic Eluga a couple of years ago for a family member. Still working well. Based on that experience I purchased this newer model i7, but it was such a big disappointment. Phone was excruciatingly slow, photos were grainy and many more issues. Didn't expect such low quality from a well known brand. Fortunately I was able to return it.
,
  The phone is an alternative to chinese companies flooding the market. Display is very dull, fingerprint sensor at times doesnt work, but not a deal breaker, can live with it. Low quality screen guard already stuck when delivered makes the display worse. There was an extra screen guard, wondering if I got a returned product, box seemed sealed and all though.,Apart from that, its a good VFM (< ₹7000) phone with a lot of features some of its competitors dont have. Its a functional smartphone without the unnecessary apps (data stealing ones) which comes loaded with other phones. Battery backup is good. Overall good for a senior citizen or users who dont waste their lives staring at cellphone screens and use it for communicating and a bit of internet usage.
,
  Fair product at this price. But disappointed me for rough performance. It's processor is quite slow and have a worst camera, specially the front camera. It's display brightness is just fair. Fingerprint sensor is good. It can be buyed for general usage like phone calls, social media and light games. Overall a good product
,
  After using three days  mobile getting hagged,And getting switch off automatically.,Charging was 80%  while on call switched off automatically when power on it shows battery charging 20 %
,
  Camera is not good. This phone is not a new era phone. Phone function make this phone is old era phone. No sim tray available in phone. One sim is nano sim and other is Micro sim. No place to insert SD Card. Back camera works like a 2MP camera. Picture quality is very bed. Not a good phone. Phone voice is not loud.  This is only basic phone. In this budget can be buy a good phone.

  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.,Pros:,Design and built quality - superb.,Display - Smoothness and view is very impressive,Finger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.,Rear camera - Good as considering the price.,Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.,Call quality very fine,Cons:,Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game,Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform,For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.,Macro camera - useless feature,Front camera - Average,Ui is fine but consuming more ram,Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).,Final,Normal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).,If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.,Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.,Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue.

  The battery life is good but doesn't contains a Fast Charger,even the storage is spacious. The Camera quality is fine and totally meets the expectation. The overall phone is nice but not strong enough to handle highly specified apps, like we can easily notice the lags while scrolling up/down in the YouTube trending and Instagram surfing threads. The frame rate has already been dropped. So, won't be able to access PUBG or COD not more than Low graphics and Medium FPS even the response is slower (as if playing Devil May Cry 4 in AMD Athlon processor attached PC)

  I was looking for a phone to be gifted to my mom... But below 10k the configurations and brands weren't enough pleasing but then when I found Vivo it was just so perfect.,The color of the back side of mobile is so elegant,the camera quality is also very good, clear and battery life is great.
,
  This is a review as a moderate user.,1. Agate red is stylish......,2. Battery life stands three days with moderate gaming of aproximate 1 hr per day (free fire) on low power mode.,3. Camera is ok for this price range.,4. Dispay is good.,5. Gaming performace is good when playing freefire in smooth and standard settings.,6. There are lots of feature in this phone like low power mode, ultra power saving mode, game mode, one hand mode, etc... Check YouTube videos for the features.,7. Finger print reader and face recognition is fast. I prefer finger print and turn off face recognition for saving battery life.,8. The best thing is, I bought this phone using amazon paylater for zero emi for three months.
,
  Just wow. Beautiful red colour vivo y11.
,
  I bought it for my mother, she uses to make video calls and surfing YouTube. Ideal for basic use. The pricing could be 1k less for this kind of configuration. Over all good product if you are not going to play games and keep cleaning junk from your phone. Like other vivo phones it also has unwanted advertisements.

  Damaged product

  Its compact feel better for day today normal usage. Very good mobile for all users who require a handy good looking Mobile which can perform all the task well.. display is good... Most practical phone in this price..
,
  Nice phone from Samsung in this price. Display is good . Camera is not awsome but average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. N it has all necessary features. I got this for 8999 . So good phone under 10 k.As samsung so last for years.
,
  Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,,Pros.,* Perfect size,* Samsung brand,* Good build quality for this price,* Android 10,* One UI 2,Cons.,* camera is below average,* Average display quality,* No earphones in the box,* No fingerprint scanner,* Takes very long time to charge battery.,Will update this review after few weeks.
,
  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.,This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.
,
  This smartphone is very handy and responsive. The cameras are not as good as other smartphones in this price but it gets the job done. If you want a very hand and easy to use smartphone this is it. The quality is the best in this segment.,Pros:,1. Small, handy and light weight,2. Display is good,3. battery capacity is good,4. fast and responsive for normal tasks,5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable"",cons:,1. Not for gaming,2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes,3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.
,
  I have been using it for a week.,I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.,The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.,The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.,Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.,A good to buy phone for  9000
,
  Its not value for money,  just passable,  its very tiny phone, not wider enough,  please see length and widths specification specifically.,Very slow charging,Not good camera,If your are planning for students for class, its worthless.

  First sell, First order. Mobile is very nice...
,
  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.
,
  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.,But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.,Not recommended.,Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...,Pros.,1) good features considering cost 6800.,2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt,3) Speakers are good Dolby,4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...,5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...,6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800,7) 5000mAh battery,8) can be use as power bank for other phones,Cons:,1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...,2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...,This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...
,
  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,,Review score (out of 5),Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...,Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor),Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.,Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.,Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours),Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available,Pros : apart from above mentioned points :,1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung),2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.,3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly,4)face detection is fast,5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming,6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses,Cons:,1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high,2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option,3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro,4) no fast charger with pack
,
  Good Phone With Exchange
,
  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...,But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...,Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..,Thanks Oppo
,
  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge
,
  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?
,
  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device
,
  Pros- Phone looks actually good,  Good battery life,Cons- phone is too heavy,  Camera performance not upto the,  mark.,Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.

   Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GB,Things I like:,* Big Display which is well lit,* Light weight,* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern,* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating),* Camera is above average,* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12),* USB-C & Headphone jack,* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF,* No bloatwares except Google apps,* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gestures,Things I didn't liked:,* Camera performance in low light,* Screen ratio (bit longer),* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+),* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range),In the box:,* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.,Conclusion:,It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).,This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.,Go for it, you'll be happy.,Note: Charger is ""Made in China""
,
  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.,Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for.
,
  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:,> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.,> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.,> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.,Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.,The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.,There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.,> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.,> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.,> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.,Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.,Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black (EarPods & Power Adapter in The Box),"
  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.
,
  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.
,
  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
,
  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.,Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.,The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).,Cons:,1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.,2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.,Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).,But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .
,
  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

  Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return  fast,Very very bad experience
,
  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-,Pro's,1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌,2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀,3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps,4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.,5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.,6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.,7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.,8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.,9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.,10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗,11. Supports OTG as well.,Cons,1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.,2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉,3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.,4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.,Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4,Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

  Very smooth UI latest M series .,Battery is good. 3000mah,It has dark mode.,Apps run smoothly.,Camera is average.,Best for secondary phone.,Apps are of GO version,WiFi calling feature.

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.
,
  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.
,
  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.
,
  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.,  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.,1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.,2. Smooth touch sensitivity,3. Ringtones are much louder.,4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.,5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.,6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.,7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.,8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.,8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.,  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.
,
  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.,By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.,We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".,Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.,  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.,-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.,What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.,Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Its compact feel better for day today normal usage. Very good mobile for all users who require a handy good looking Mobile which can perform all the task well.. display is good... Most practical phone in this price..
,
  Nice phone from Samsung in this price. Display is good . Camera is not awsome but average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. N it has all necessary features. I got this for 8999 . So good phone under 10 k.As samsung so last for years.
,
  Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,,Pros.,* Perfect size,* Samsung brand,* Good build quality for this price,* Android 10,* One UI 2,Cons.,* camera is below average,* Average display quality,* No earphones in the box,* No fingerprint scanner,* Takes very long time to charge battery.,Will update this review after few weeks.
,
  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.,This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.
,
  This smartphone is very handy and responsive. The cameras are not as good as other smartphones in this price but it gets the job done. If you want a very hand and easy to use smartphone this is it. The quality is the best in this segment.,Pros:,1. Small, handy and light weight,2. Display is good,3. battery capacity is good,4. fast and responsive for normal tasks,5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable"",cons:,1. Not for gaming,2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes,3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.
,
  I have been using it for a week.,I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.,The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.,The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.,Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.,A good to buy phone for  9000
,
  Its not value for money,  just passable,  its very tiny phone, not wider enough,  please see length and widths specification specifically.,Very slow charging,Not good camera,If your are planning for students for class, its worthless.

"Tecno Spark 6 Air (Ocean Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","
  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.,Pros,Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days,Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing),Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot,Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash,Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use,Cons,Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)
,
  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.
,
  Easily the best specifications at 7999.,Was planning to get Spark Power 2.,But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.

So this review is considering 6800 cost...,Pros.,1) good features considering cost 6800.,2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt,3) Speakers are good Dolby,4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...,5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...,6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800,7) 5000mAh battery,8) can be use as power bank for other phones,Cons:,1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...,2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...,This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...
,
  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,,Review score (out of 5),Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...,Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor),Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.,Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.,Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours),Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available,Pros : apart from above mentioned points :,1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung),2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.,3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly,4)face detection is fast,5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming,6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses,Cons:,1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high,2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option,3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro,4) no fast charger with pack

  Good Phone With Exchange
,
  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...,But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...,Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..,Thanks Oppo
,
  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge
,
  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?
,
  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device
,
  Pros- Phone looks actually good,  Good battery life,Cons- phone is too heavy,  Camera performance not upto the,  mark.,Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White (EarPods & Power Adapter in The Box),"
  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.
,
  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.
,
  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
,
  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.,Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.,The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).,Cons:,1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.,2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.,Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).,But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .
,
  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.
,
  Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return  fast,Very very bad experience
,
  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

The quality is the best in this segment.,Pros:,1. Small, handy and light weight,2. Display is good,3. battery capacity is good,4. fast and responsive for normal tasks,5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable"",cons:,1. Not for gaming,2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes,3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.

  I have been using it for a week.,I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.,The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.,The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.,Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.,A good to buy phone for  9000
,
  Its not value for money,  just passable,  its very tiny phone, not wider enough,  please see length and widths specification specifically.,Very slow charging,Not good camera,If your are planning for students for class, its worthless.

  The headphone jack is not working  😡 Despite the customer care approved the replacement the delivery boy is not listening to them.He is standing at the door, calling this or that official and not replacing my phone. I feel so much harassed. Please somebody intervene.

  First sell, First order. Mobile is very nice...

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .,Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.,1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ),3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .,Rest all other functions are good  .
,
   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.,heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.,Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.,But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.,Not recommended.,Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.,Good:,- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!,- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.,- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.,- 6000 Mah battery is BIG,- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.,- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE,- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.,- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.,- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.,- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good,- Received next day by 11 AM !,Not So Good:,- Not that thin, but ok.,- Doesn't have Samsung Dex,- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.,- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :),- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.,Feedback,- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.,- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.,Go for it without any doubt.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
,
  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.,Cons:,1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.,2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.,3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.,Pros:,1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.,2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.,3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.
,
  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.,64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.,Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.,Face unlock very slow.,Heat issue which charging and heavy usage,Full charge takes more than 3 hrs,Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone,go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality
,
  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.,Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.,However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.,So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.,Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.
,
  Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.
,
  Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money .

"OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","
  ==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====,I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.,OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.,===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====,+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.,+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.,+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.,+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.,+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro),+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.,==== What's in the Box? ====,OnePlus 7T Pro Device.,User Manual.,Transparent Silicon Case.,SIM Ejector Tool.,Warp 30T Charging Brick.,Type C USB Cable.,And some cool OnePlus Stickers.,==== Display ====,Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.,==== Performance ====,Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.,==== Camera ====,I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.,==== Video ====,If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.,==== Software ====,This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.,==== Battery ====,Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.,==== What could've been improved ====,- Minor improvements on Camera.,- No ToF sensor,- No Wireless Charging.,- IP Rating.,- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.,==== Verdict ====,No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.,If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.,If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.

  I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.,I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this:,1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.,2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.,3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.,4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.,5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.,The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it.,Go for it guys !! You won't regret.

  Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced. There are no hiccups, none what so ever. Overall smooth experience between switching apps and regular functions.,The Display is to die for.,Magnificent Macro mode and Night mode  in camera.,There is just nothing wrong with it.,Overall an overwhelming experience.,Call of Duty runs flawlessly ...,The phone is so fast it takes some getting used to.,Charging speed as advertised.,No Complaints.
,
  Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back,1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA.,The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM.,NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR,IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.,IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR.,THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY.,SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.,Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates.,Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.
,
  Just as I expected, beautiful and powerful.,And yes, it works with both my VERIZON & GOOGLE FI sim cards in place. (See Photo),Good seller and fast shipping.
,
  So far it has been a really good phone with excellent charge speed and a big HD screen. The Oxygen OS is really intuitive and performs quite well. My only gripe is that this phone drains it's battery pretty fast, and when you put a screen protector on it the fingerprint reader doesn't work hardly at all.

  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon,They do not refund if your product got defected.,Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon,Regarding mobile,Worst mobile i have ever seen,Battery charging time is more than expected.,Battery drainaing problem is there,Camera will stuck when you click pictures.,Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.,I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.,Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.,Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.,I would give  you my honest experience..,I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.,2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..,So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.,3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.,6.sound is average,,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound),Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.,Thanks 👍

"Tecno Spark 6 Air (Ocean Blue, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","
  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.,Pros,Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days,Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing),Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot,Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash,Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use,Cons,Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)

  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.

"Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White (Includes EarPods, Power Adapter)","
  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.
,
  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.
,
  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
,
  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.,Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.,The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).,Cons:,1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.,2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.,Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).,But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .
,
  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

  Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return  fast,Very very bad experience
,
  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.,Pros:,Design and built quality - superb.,Display - Smoothness and view is very impressive,Finger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.,Rear camera - Good as considering the price.,Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.,Call quality very fine,Cons:,Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game,Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform,For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.,Macro camera - useless feature,Front camera - Average,Ui is fine but consuming more ram,Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).,Final,Normal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).,If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.,Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.,Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.

  Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge.

"OPPO A5 2020 (Mirror Black, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","
  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...,Pros.,1) good features considering cost 6800.,2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt,3) Speakers are good Dolby,4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...,5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...,6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800,7) 5000mAh battery,8) can be use as power bank for other phones,Cons:,1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...,2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...,This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,,Review score (out of 5),Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...,Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor),Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.,Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.,Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours),Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available,Pros : apart from above mentioned points :,1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung),2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.,3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly,4)face detection is fast,5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming,6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses,Cons:,1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high,2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option,3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro,4) no fast charger with pack

  Good Phone With Exchange
,
  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...,But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...,Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..,Thanks Oppo

  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge
,
  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?

  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device

  Pros- Phone looks actually good,  Good battery life,Cons- phone is too heavy,  Camera performance not upto the,  mark.,Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

"TECNO Spark 6 Air (Comet Black, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","
  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.,Pros,Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days,Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing),Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot,Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash,Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use,Cons,Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay,Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.,Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.,Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)

  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.

  Easily the best specifications at 7999.,Was planning to get Spark Power 2.,But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.
